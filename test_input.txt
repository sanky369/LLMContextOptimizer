The natural language processing model uses deep learning and machine learning techniques.
It combines neural networks with attention mechanisms for better understanding.
The large language model implementation uses transformer models with self-attention:
```python
def process_text(self):
    return self.model.generate(
        input_text,
        temperature=0.7,
        max_length=100
    )
```
This approach leverages retrieval augmented generation for improved results.
